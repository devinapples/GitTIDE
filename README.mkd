Introduction
============
This following document details how to get Terminal IDE up and running on an Android device.
YMMV!

Copy the setupGITonTIDE.sh file for TIDE:
`https://raw.github.com/devinapples/GitTIDE/master/setupGITonTIDE.sh`

Change the file to be executable:
`chmod 777 setupGITonTIDE.sh`

Run the file!
`./setupGITonTIDE.sh`

Lastly: open the key in TIDE to copy and paste the public key to GitHub OR open the file in the web browser (file:///sdcard/pub.key).
